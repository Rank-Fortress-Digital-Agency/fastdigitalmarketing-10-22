                    The chances are if the words lead generation got your attention, and you’re reading this still you need my help. The chances are you probably have never built a company from scratch and sold it for 136 million either. If you have, that’s cool too, and we can trade stories or, should I say, nightmares? Lol. I’m no fancy pants born with a golden spoon in my mouth either, and I’m sure as hell not so smart I’m stupid either. I never went to college and was raised by a single mother who worked at Walmart and actually met Sam Walton on several occasions when he went into the store she was working at. She shopped at garage sales and then resold at her own garage sale way before the internet even existed. My point is she taught me an incredible work ethic so If I decide to take your company on, I will work my ass off to make you number#1, and I won’t be working for your competitor at the same time. I got a story about that also! Plus I don’t sleep saving that for when I die.

                Let’s turn your brand into something great! Content marketing involves creating different types of content for various platforms (e.g., blogs, social media posts, etc.) so that they may reach out to their target audience via these channels. Every experience gives you opportunities to gain new knowledge and expertise. Blogs, email campaigns, videos, websites—they’re just some examples. Well written content may be the tipping point for some people when deciding whether they want to buy from you. In addition, linking to other reputable sites and blogging on them can significantly improve your own site’s domain strength.

            <p>
                When developing a marketing plan for any business, one of the first questions we ask ourselves is “What is the lifetime value of each individual customer?” To answer this question, we need to understand the difference between a single time customer and a lifetime customer. Knowing this value is essential for understanding and developing an effective marketing strategy. We work together with our design team, content creators, and marketers to create engaging experiences for our clients’ websites. We’ve got some proven strategies for finding great content ideas.
            </p>
            <p>
                Social media marketing profiles and online marketing directories are also important factors that play a significant role in local SEO. Having a variety of information on these platforms can help people find your business easily, but it can additionally confuse them. Sometimes, businesses will additionally appear on multiple social media platforms even if they didn’t create a profile.
